\maketitle

\#a) table(movie{[}, 1:2{]}) \# This study is unbalanced as the number
of observations is unequal. \# The different levels of each factor
combination have different size groups.

\#b) with(movie, interaction.plot(Gender, Genre, Score)) with(movie,
interaction.plot(Genre, Gender, Score)) \# By looking at the plots there
is indication that there is some interaction between the factors and the
response, as there are different slopes between the levels of each
factor. \# The interaction is not significant as the sample size is too
low , but there is a slight change in the slope of the variable lines.

boxplot(Score \textasciitilde{} as.factor(Gender) + as.factor(Genre),
data = movie) \# box plot shows constant variability between the levels
of each factor.

\#c) Mathematical Model movie.lm = lm(Score \textasciitilde{}
as.factor(Gender) + as.factor(Genre), data = movie) anova(movie.lm)
summary(movie.lm)\$coefficients \# Yi = µ + αi + βj + γij + εi \# Yi =
score response \# µ = overall mean \# α = Gender effect for i = 1,2 \# β
= Genre effect for j = 1,2,3 \#γij = interaction between Gender and
Genre

\#d) \# Test: Effect of Gender on Score \# Null hypothesis - H0: There
is interaction between Gender and Score \# Alternative Hypothesis - H1:
There is no interaction between Gender and Score

movie.1 = lm(Score \textasciitilde{} as.factor(Gender), data = movie)
anova(movie.1) \# In this test we reject the null hypothesis \#
Therefore there is no interaction between Gender and Score

plot(movie.1, which = 1:2) \# The diagnostic plots validates the model.
\# On the residual vs fitted plot each cell has a similar variance. \#
Quantile plot of residuals shows a close linear relationship, suggesting
they are normally distributed.

movie.2 = lm(Score \textasciitilde{} as.factor(Genre), data = movie)
anova(movie.2) \# In this test we reject the null hypothesis \#
Therefore, there is no interaction between Genre and Score

plot(movie.2, which = 1:2) \# The diagnostic plots validates the model.
\# On the residual vs fitted plot each cell has again a similar
variance. \# Quantile plot of residuals shows a close linear
relationship, suggesting they are normally distributed.
